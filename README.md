# HRsByBallStrikeCount

Analysis of MLB homeruns broken down by ball-strike counts.  Motivated by the Baseball Prospectus article by Tom Wiser at https://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/article/52470/from-the-outfield-grass-getting-ahead-and-paying-the-price/#comment-210248

The analysis, in particular, investigates the change in the number of homeruns being hit on or through particular ball-strike counts.  Somewhat surprisingly, the analysis shows that there has been a slight reduction in the percentage of homeruns hit on or through hitter-friendly counts (i.e., 3-1 and 2-0) and a slight increase in the percentage of homeruns hit in or through counts that are traditionally thought to favor the pitcher (0-2, 1-2 and 2-2).
